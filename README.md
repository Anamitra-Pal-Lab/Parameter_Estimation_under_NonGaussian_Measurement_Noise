# Transmission_Line_Parameter_Estimation
The EGLE algorithm for parameter estimation in presence of non-Gaussian measurements and related data

Objective: Novel optimal parameter estimation algorithm (optimal even when the measurement noise is non-Gaussian)

A general regression problem of the form c = D x is considered.

Nomenclature:
